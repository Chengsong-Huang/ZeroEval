Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:\n - Each person has a unique name: `Peter`, `Eric`, `Arnold`.\n - Each person has a unique favorite drink: `tea`, `water`, `milk`\n\n## Clues for the Example Puzzle\n\n1. Peter is in the second house.\n2. Arnold is directly left of the one who only drinks water.\n3. The one who only drinks water is directly left of the person who likes milk.\n\n## Answer to the Example Puzzle\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Given Clue 1, we know Peter is in House 2. According to Clue 2, Arnold is directly left of the one who only drinks water. The person in House 3 cannot be on the left of anyone, so Arnold must be in House 1. Thus, Peter drinks water, and Eric lives in House 3. Then, according to Clue 3, Eric drinks milk. Therefore, Arnold drinks tea.\",\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"Arnold\",\n            \"Drink\": \"tea\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"Peter\",\n            \"Drink\": \"water\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"Eric\",\n            \"Drink\": \"milk\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# Puzzle to Solve \n\nThere are 5 houses, numbered 1 to 5 from left to right, as seen from across the street.

The person who loves fantasy books is the Norwegian.\n2. The cat lover and the person who loves biography books are next to each other.\n3. The German is Bob.\n4. The person who loves yellow is Bob.\n5. The person whose favorite color is green is Peter.\n6. There is one house between the Dane and the person who is a pizza lover.\n7. The person who loves blue is somewhere to the left of the Dane.\n8. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is somewhere to the left of the Norwegian.\n9. The person who loves the spaghetti eater is Peter.\n10. The person who keeps horses is Alice.\n11. The fish enthusiast is directly left of the person who loves science fiction books.\n12. There is one house between the Norwegian and Arnold.\n13. The person who loves romance books is the British person.\n14. There are two houses between the Norwegian and Alice.\n15.
